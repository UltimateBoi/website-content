## Introduction
Whatever the reason, you’re here cause you want to have a pair of AirPods, 
but it’s likely that you just can’t justify spending $150+ dollars on a pair of earphones (
or $250+ for AirPods Pros) that will last you a year or two, or maybe even shorter as they’re easily lost.

Well after reading this guide, there's almost no reason to buy AirPods from Apple, as the 
replicas are almost as good and getting better day by day.

So… **ENTER** → The “AirReps Ultimate Guide” !

This guide is made to help you and the community quickly find out everything about the best replica AirPods, 
what to look out for, how to buy and troubleshoot.

We are constantly updating this guide, so if you’re reading this, it will be the latest information available.

## What is ANC?
As mentioned in this guide, Active Noise Cancellation or ANC for short, is a technological feature 
that gives a sensation of “cancelled noise” to a listener. This is done using the principles of constructive 
and destructive interference, where an “anti-noise” that opposes the sound waves of the ambient outside noise 
is produced, leading to a cancellation effect.

While ANC ideally strives to eliminate as much external noise as possible, very few headsets actually provide a 
completely noiseless experience.

While the fundamental concept of ANC is consistent, there are 3 individual implementations: 
Feedback, Feedforward and Hybrid, each variation with its own advantages and disadvantages.


### Feedback ANC (Filter Microphone inside the ear cup)
This method revolves around a microphone placed within the ear cup, so that it picks up exactly the same 
sounds that the listener would be exposed to, allowing it to better adapt to sudden changes and signal corrections. 
It works on a fairly large range of frequencies, and still works fairly well even if the headset is worn in an odd 
or unfamiliar fashion.

However, it struggles to handle high frequency sounds, being particularly unsuccessful in surprising noise between 
the 1000-2000 Hz range. An improper design also poses the risk of noise feedback (high-pitch shrill that sometimes 
comes from a microphone). Also, because the filter microphone is inside the ear cup, feedback AN can quite easily 
filter out your music as it gets mixed in with the noise, it's trying to cancel.

### Feedforward ANC (Filter Microphone outside the ear cup)
A feedforward setup centers around an external microphone, which processes the noise before the user hears it and then 
creates an anti-noise frequency before sending the filtered noise to the listener. This is great because it captures 
the noise early and hence has more time to respond in the production of the anti-noise. This allows it to better 
succeed at reducing high-frequency noises of up to 1000-2000 Hz.

Unfortunately, it lacks self-correction, since it never actually gets to hear the anti-noise it's producing. 
It just assumes that the person listening won’t hear any noise. If the headset is slanted weirdly, this can sometimes 
end up amplifying the noise at certain frequencies.

Also, feedforward ANC works in a much smaller range of frequencies and since it’s external, it’s much more exposed to 
the outside world and sensitive to noises like wind.

### Hybrid ANC (Filter Microphone inside AND outside the ear cup)
As the name suggests, the hybrid variations combine the best of both worlds by having an external and internal 
microphone. This means you essentially get all the benefits and no disadvantages. Hybrid ANC suppresses noise at a 
broader range, adapts to sudden changes in noise and isn’t sensitive to headset placement.

Obviously this comes at a great cost, as the utilisation of two microphones, often results in up to double the 
price. The technology behind Hybrid ANC is more complicated and requires more expertise to perfect, making it 
pricier overall. Apple’s retail AirPods Pros use this hybrid variation, which is one of the reasons for their 
high pricing. We can even see examples of this technology being replicated in the AirPods clone market. HiCity’s 
newly released v4.5 (featuring the Airoha 1562A chipset) also replicates the hybrid ANC effect to provide a full 
and authentic noise cancelling experience
