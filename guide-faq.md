### Do AirPods Pro sound better than AirPods 2
Since AirPods Pro actually seals into the ear, they sound significantly better 
than AirPods 2, which are shaped to let outside noise in. 
However, the AirPods 2 clones do sound closer to the original than the AirPods Pro 
clones at this point. Get whichever shape and fit you prefer

### A website/youtuber says they have xxx feature
The versions sold on Alibaba are the very latest that are widely available. 
Don't believe websites or YouTuber's who say they have an even newer version 
with x and y new features.

### How do I change settings on Android? 
If you use Android, make all your touch settings changes on an iPhone 
[https://airreps.info/iossettings] it should carry over to your Android 
.(although sometimes this doesn't work)

### Can I charge replicas in an authentic case?
No. They will charge, but there is a chance they will break soon after. 
Don't charge fake pods in a real case, and don't charge real pods in a fake case.

### Will AirPods cases fit?
All soft silicone protective cases will fit, but hard plastic cases won't 
fit most clones (mostly older models as they are a bit bigger than the originals). 
Some hard cases will fit, but may not come of or mess up the button if it sticks out a bit.

### Are AirPods Max replicas out yet?
Airpods Max replicas are not out just yet, but we expect to see them within 
the next 1-2 months. The price is expected to be 80-90$ along with Airoha and 
supposedly Jerry chipsets being utilized. 
Stay tuned at r/AirReps and the AirReps Discord to be informed exactly when they 
are released!

### Another community has newer products?
The products listed above are the greatest of the greatest, 
we update it every day and make sure the product quality meets our 
standards before it makes it way onto the guide, similar communities might 
have lower standards and want to show that they have the newest products even 
though they might not have them at all. It could also be caused due to them using 
a different naming scheme than AirReps.

### Which one is the best?  
The * one rep at the top of the list is the latest model, the other ones are previous models. 
Find one that fits your budget, ships to your country, has the features you need etc. 
Search for its reviews and make your own decision.

### What version is the replica that I found?  
There's no way to tell without using it - pictures and chip numbers that 
sellers tell you don't mean anything. Don't ask sellers things like "is this v2.5?", 
they won't understand. You can buy random ones if you want to take the risk. 
Otherwise, buy from the verified sellers above to know exactly which model you're getting

### How do I check what chip I have?
Download the Airoha Headset app and try to connect your AirPods to it. 
If they connect they are Airoha. You can also download the 
[AirReps 156X Airoha app](https://airreps.info/android) 
on Android and try to connect your AirPods to the app. 
The app will tell you exactly what chipset is being used in your reps 
(only if they are Airoha).

:::note
> To do this you need to use an Android 8.1 or Higher but lower than 10 device, or Mac.

If they don't connect, then use the following method:

- [Android](https://airreps.info/androidcodeccheck)
- [macOS](https://airreps.info/maccodeccheck)

At the moment, it is hard to tell from the codec, as most chipsets now support AAC, 
**but if it has SBC you can be sure the reps are using a lower end chipset.**

### How do I check my AirPods are real? 
The quickest way is to connect them to an iPhone and go to:
```
Settings -> General -> About
```
There should be an "AirPods" section when you scroll down. 
* If there is no AirPods section, it's fake. 
* If there is an AirPods section, make sure the Serial Number shown there 
matches the serial number on the inside of the AirPods lid -http://airreps.info/aboutsection
  * However, some of the newest reps do have a working about page. 
    In this case, for the Airpods Pro, you can check if Spatial Audio is working. 
    
* Enable Spatial Audio and make sure there is a noticeable difference in sound 
  and that head tracking is working correctly. 
  If the About page is there, for Airpods, you can check the firmware version in 
  the About page - make sure it matches the latest AirPods firmware released by Apple.

If you can't do this before buying, make a post on the 
[r/AirReps](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirReps)
or on [Discord](https://airreps.link/discord) and someone will help you.

 
### Is i9999, SuperPods, etc. better than SuperCopy or the links in the guide?  
These names used to represent upgrades etc. 
Sadly, sellers saw this as an opportunity to make it look like they had the 
newer product while just selling the same product. Ignore all the numbers that 
sellers use, and marketing words like "superpods" - they don't mean anything anymore.
 
### Will I get a good quality unit?  
Build quality, sound quality, reliability, is are always a gamble with reps. 
You could buy 2 of the same product from the same seller, and the quality could 
be completely different. There is no way to guarantee good quality, but the sellers 
above usually have good quality.

### How do I contact sellers?
Join the AirReps [Discord Server](https://airreps.link/discord) for all the seller's 
WhatsApp numbers since they are not publicized. You can also message them through 
Ali by clicking "Contact Supplier".
 
### Minimum order is more than one?   
Click "Buy Sample" to buy just a single one or just contact the seller informing 
you need only one. They can create an order for you.

**I ORDERED x DAYS AGO AND IT HASN'T ARRIVED YET?**  
### I ordered XX days ago, and it hasn't arrived yet
It can take a while to ship out from China. 
Tracking disappears when it leaves China and only updates once it 
reaches customs in your country. 
If it's been a long time and there still isn't even a tracking number, message your 
seller for an update.

> If your tracking info is in Chinese, copy the tracking number and paste it into 
> [17Track](https://www.17track.net/) or [ParcelsApp](http://parcelsapp.com/)

### My card doesn't work  
Message the seller and ask if they'll take a different form of payment 
(beware that some alternative payment methods don't offer buyer protection e.g. 
Transferwise and Xoom). If not, try another card or a different seller. 
You can also try verifying your card through Apple Pay (if you have access to an 
iOS device), and purchasing through Apple Pay.
 
### Shipping cost is too high 
Message the seller and ask if they can offer cheaper shipping through ePacket etc, 
or see if they can ship it through an agent. If not, try a different seller.
